# edtech-notes-backend
A simple backend API built with FastAPI that allows users (students) to create, read, update, and delete notes. This project simulates a basic note-taking feature commonly found in educational platforms and is ideal for understanding core backend concepts like RESTful APIs, routing, data validation, and in-memory storage.
